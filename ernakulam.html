    <p style="font-style: italic;font-family: cursive;">The word Ernakulam has a varied derivation, with some references to mythology and others to temples. According to Komattil Achutha Menon, the word Erangiyal got its start from a particular kind of mud. In the past, Lord Shiva was referred to as Erayanar in Chennai. This was done in Kerala as well, and it became known as Ernakulam after that. There are also other opinions about the origin of the name, saying that Rishinagakulam became Ernakulam after losing it, but that the word Ernakulam came from Ernakulathappan Temple , and that it came from the word Kulam (Pond) for a long time 
        because it was full of water bodies.The region can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period.[3] The early political history of Ernakulam is interlinked with that of the Chera Dynasty of the Sangam age, who ruled over vast portions of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. After the Cheras, 
        the place was later ruled by the Kingdom of Cochin (Perumpadapu Swaroopam)</p>
